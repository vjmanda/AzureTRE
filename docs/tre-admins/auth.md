# Authentication and authorization

[Azure Active Directory (AAD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) is the backbone of Authentication and Authorization in the TRE.

It holds the identities of all TRE/workspace users, including administrators, and connects the identities with app registrations defining the privileges per user roles.

## App registrations

App registrations (represented by service principals) define the privileges enabling access to the TRE system (e.g., [API](../tre-developers/api.md)) as well as the workspaces.

You can create the app registrations needed for the API by running the `/scripts/aad-app-reg.sh` script.

Alternatively, you can create the app registrations manually via the [Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). The requirements are listed below.

!!! note
    Additional app registrations are required to run the E2E tests, and also to create workspaces - these are not configured by the `aad-app-reg.sh` script. Find information below on how to set these up.

Some of the applications require **admin consent** to allow them to validate users against the AAD. Check the Microsoft Docs on [Configure the admin consent workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow) on how to request admin consent and handle admin consent requests.

### App registration script

The `/scripts/aad-app-reg.sh` script automatically sets up the app registrations with the required permissions to run Azure TRE. It will create and configure the two main app registrations: **TRE API** and **TRE Swagger UI**.

Example on how to run the script:

```bash
./aad-app-reg.sh \
    --name <Prefix of the app registration names e.g., TRE> \
    --swaggerui-redirecturl https://<TRE ID>.<Azure location>.cloudapp.azure.com/api/docs/oauth2-redirect \
    --admin-consent
```

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `--name` | The prefix of the name of the app registrations. `TRE` will give you `TRE API` and `TRE Swagger UI`. |
| `--swaggerui-redirecturl` | The reply URL for the Swagger UI app. Use the values of the [environment variables](./environment-variables.md) `TRE_ID` and `LOCATION` in the URL. Reply URL for the localhost, `http://localhost:8000/api/docs/oauth2-redirect`, will be added by default. |
| `--admin-consent` | Grants admin consent for the app registrations. This is required for them to function properly, but requires AAD admin privileges. |

!!! caution
    The script will create an app password (client secret) for the **TRE API** app; make sure to take note of it in the script output as it is only shown once. In case the secret is lost, the script, when run again, can reset it and display the new one.


In addition to the `TRE API` and `TRE Swagger UI` app registrations, the `aad-app-reg.sh` script can also be used to create an app registration that can be used for authenticating against the API from automation (for example, for registering bundles via CI/CD). To do this, add the `--automation-account` switch as shown in the following command:

```bash
./aad-app-reg.sh \
    --name <Prefix of the app registration names e.g., TRE> \
    --swaggerui-redirecturl https://<TRE ID>.<Azure location>.cloudapp.azure.com/api/docs/oauth2-redirect \
    --automation-account \
    --admin-consent
```

### TRE API

The **TRE API** app registration defines the permissions, scopes and app roles for API users to authenticate and authorize API calls.

#### API permissions - TRE API

| API/permission name | Type | Description | Admin consent required | Status | TRE usage |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Microsoft Graph/Directory.Read.All (`https://graph.microsoft.com/Directory.Read.All`) | Application* | Allows the app to read data in your organization's directory, such as users, groups and apps, without a signed-in user. | Yes | Granted for *[directory name]* | Used e.g., to retrieve app registration details, user associated app roles etc. |
| Microsoft Graph/User.Read.All (`https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read.All`) | Application* | Allows the app to read user profiles without a signed in user. | Yes | Granted for *[directory name]* | Reading user role assignments to check that the user has permissions to execute an action e.g., to view workspaces. See `/api_app/services/aad_authentication.py`. |

*) See the difference between [delegated and application permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/auth/auth-concepts#delegated-and-application-permissions) types.

See [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference) for more details.

#### Scopes - TRE API

* `api://<Application (client) ID>/` **`user_impersonation`** - Allow the app to access the TRE API on behalf of the signed-in user

#### App roles - TRE API

| Display name | Description | Allowed member types | Value |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| TRE Administrators | Provides resource administrator access to the TRE. | Users/Groups,Applications | `TREAdmin` |
| TRE Users | Provides access to the TRE application. | Users/Groups,Applications | `TREUser` |

#### Authentication - TRE API

The **TRE API** app registration requires no redirect URLs defined or anything else for that matter. From a security standpoint it should be noted that public client flows should not be allowed. As the identity of the client application cannot be verified (see the image below taken from app registration authentication blade in Azure Portal).

![Allow public client flows - No](../assets/app-reg-authentication-allow-public-client-flows-no.png)

### TRE Swagger UI

**TRE Swagger UI** app registration:

* Controls the access to the Swagger UI of the TRE API
* Has no scopes or app roles defined

#### API permissions - TRE Swagger UI

| API/permission name | Type | Description | Admin consent required | Status |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| Microsoft Graph/offline_access (`https://graph.microsoft.com/offline_access`) | Delegated* | Allows the app to see and update the data you gave it access to, even when users are not currently using the app. | No | Granted for *[directory name]* |
| Microsoft Graph/openid (`https://graph.microsoft.com/openid`) | Delegated* | Allows users to sign in to the app with their work or school accounts and allows the app to see basic user profile information. | No | Granted for *[directory name]* |
| TRE API/user_impersonation (`api://<TRE API Application (client) ID>/user_impersonation`) | Delegated* | See [TRE API app registration scopes](#scopes---tre-api). | No | Granted for *[directory name]* |

*) See the difference between [delegated and application permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/auth/auth-concepts#delegated-and-application-permissions) types.

#### Authentication - TRE Swagger UI

Redirect URLs:

* `https://<TRE ID>.<Azure location>.cloudapp.azure.com/docs/oauth2-redirect`
* `http://localhost:8000/docs/oauth2-redirect` - For local testing

### TRE e2e test

The **TRE e2e test** app registration is used to authorize end-to-end test scenarios. It has no scopes or app roles defined.

!!! note
    - This app registration is only needed and used for **testing**
    - As of writing this, there is no automated way provided for creating the **TRE e2e test** app registration, so it needs to be created manually.

#### API permissions - TRE e2e test

| API/permission name | Type | Description | Admin consent required |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Microsoft Graph/openid (`https://graph.microsoft.com/openid`) | Delegated | Allows users to sign in to the app with their work or school accounts and allows the app to see basic user profile information. | No |
| Microsoft Graph/User.Read (`https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`) | Delegated | Allows users to sign-in to the app, and allows the app to read the profile of signed-in users. It also allows the app to read basic company information of signed-in users. | No |
| <TRE APP client>.user_impersonation | Delegated | Allow the app access the TRE API on behalf of the signed-in user | No |

#### Authentication - TRE e2e test

1. Define Redirect URLs:

    In the **TRE e2e test** app registration go to Authentication -> Add platform -> Select Mobile & Desktop and add:

    ```cmd
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient
    msal<TRE e2e test app registration application (client) ID>://auth
    ```

    ![Add auth platform](../assets/aad-add-auth-platform.png)

1. Allow public client flows (see the image below). This enables the end-to-end tests to use a username and password combination to authenticate.

    ![Allow public client flows - Yes](../assets/app-reg-authentication-allow-public-client-flows-yes.png)

!!! warning
    OAuth 2.0 Public client flow cannot verify the the client application identity, it should only be enabled if needed.

#### End-to-end test user

The end-to-end test authentication and authorization is done via a dummy user, using its username and password, dedicated just for running the tests.

The user is linked to the application (app registration) the same way as any other users (see [Enabling users](#enabling-users)).

The end-to-end test should be added to **TRE Administrator** role exposed by the **TRE API** application, and to the **Owners** role exposed by the Workspaces application.

### Workspaces

Access to workspaces is also controlled using app registrations - one per workspace. The configuration of the app registration depends on the nature of the workspace, but this section covers the typical minimum settings.

!!! caution
    The app registration for a workspace is not created by the [API](../tre-developers/api.md). One needs to be present (created manually) before using the API to provision a new workspace.

#### Authentication - Workspaces

Same as [TRE API](#authentication---tre-api).

#### API permissions - Workspaces

| API/permission name | Type | Description | Admin consent required |
| ------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Microsoft Graph/User.Read (`https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`) | Delegated | Allows users to sign-in to the app, and allows the app to read the profile of signed-in users. It also allows the app to read basic company information of signed-in users. | No |
| Workspace API/user_impersonation (`api://<Workspace API Application (client) ID>/user_impersonation`) | Delegated* | Allows the app to access the workspace API on behalf of the user | No | Granted for *[directory name]* |

#### App roles

| Display name | Description | Allowed member types | Value |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| Owners | Provides ownership access to workspace. | Users/Groups | `WorkspaceOwner` |
| Researchers | Provides access to workspace. | Users/Groups | `WorkspaceResearcher` |

## Enabling users

For a user to gain access to the system, they have to:

1. Have an identity in Azure AD
1. Be linked with an app registration and assigned a role

When these requirements are met, the user can sign-in using their credentials and use their privileges to use the API, login to workspace environment etc. based on their specific roles.

![User linked with app registrations](../assets/aad-user-linked-with-app-regs.png)

The users can also be linked via the Enterprise application view:
