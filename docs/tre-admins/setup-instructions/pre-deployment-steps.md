# Pre-deployment steps

!!! info
    See [Environment variables](../environment-variables.md) for full details of the deployment related variables.

## Set environment configuration variables of shared management resources

1. Open the `/devops/.env.sample` file and then save it without the .sample extension. You should now have a file called `.env` located in the `/devops` folder. The file contains configuration variables for the shared management infrastructure which is used to support the deployment of one or more Azure TRE instances.

2. Provide the values for the following variables:

  | Variable | Description |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  | `LOCATION` | The [Azure location (region)](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies) for all resources. E.g., `westeurope` |
  | `MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` | The shared resource group for all management resources, including the storage account. |
  | `MGMT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | The name of the storage account to hold the Terraform state and other deployment artifacts. |
  | `ACR_NAME` | A globally unique name for the [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) that will be created to store deployment images. |
  | `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | The Azure subscription ID for all resources. |

  !!! tip
      To retrieve your Azure subscription ID, use the `az` command line interface available in the development container. In the terminal window in Visual Studio Code, type `az login` followed by `az account show` to see your default subscription. Please refer to `az account -help` for further details on how to change your active subscription.

The rest of the variables can have their default values. You should now have a `.env` file that looks similar to the one below:

```plaintext
# Management infrastructure
LOCATION=westeurope
MGMT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME=aztremgmt
MGMT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=aztremgmt
TERRAFORM_STATE_CONTAINER_NAME=tfstate
ACR_NAME=aztreacr

ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=12...54e

# If you want to override the currently signed in credentials
# ARM_TENANT_ID=__CHANGE_ME__
# ARM_CLIENT_ID=__CHANGE_ME__
# ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=__CHANGE_ME__

# Debug mode
DEBUG="false"
```

## Set environment configuration variables of the Azure TRE instance

Next, you will set the configuration variables for the specific Azure TRE instance:

1. Use the terminal window in Visual Studio Code to execute the following script from within the development container:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

  !!! note
      In case you have several subscriptions and would like to change your default subscription use `az account set --subscription <desired subscription ID>`

1. Open the `/templates/core/.env.sample` file and then save it without the .sample extension. You should now have a file called `.env` located in the `/templates/core` folder.
1. Set the first one of the variables, `TRE_ID`, which is the alphanumeric, with underscores and hyphens allowed, ID for the Azure TRE instance. The value will be used in various Azure resources, and **needs to be globally unique and less than 12 characters in length**. Use only lowercase letters. Choose wisely!
1. Run the `/scripts/aad-app-reg.sh` script to create API and Swagger UI app registrations and their service principals in Azure Active Directory. The details of the script are covered [app registration script](../auth.md#app-registration-script) section of the auth document. Below is a sample where `TRE_ID` has value `mytre` and the Azure location is `westeurope`:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/aad-app-reg.sh --name TRE --swaggerui-redirecturl https://mytre.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/api/docs/oauth2-redirect --admin-consent
  ```

  !!! note
      The full functionality of the script requires directory admin privileges. You may need to contact your friendly Azure Active Directory admin to complete this step. The app registrations can be created manually in Azure Portal too. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization](../auth.md).
  
  !!! note
      If you don't have permissions and just want to create a development environment then skip this step and see the steps in the "Using a separate Azure Active Directory tenant) below.

  With the output of the script, you can now provide the required auth related values for the following variables in the `/templates/core/.env` configuration file:

  | Variable | Description |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  | `AAD_TENANT_ID` | The Azure AD Tenant ID. |
  | `API_CLIENT_ID` | API application (client) ID. |
  | `API_CLIENT_SECRET` | API application client secret. |
  | `SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID` | Swagger (OpenAPI) UI application (client) ID. |

All other variables can have their default values for now. You should now have a `.env` file that looks similar to below:

```plaintext
# Used for TRE deployment
TRE_ID=mytre
CORE_ADDRESS_SPACE="10.1.0.0/22"
TRE_ADDRESS_SPACE="10.0.0.0/12"
DEPLOY_GITEA=true
RESOURCE_PROCESSOR_TYPE="vmss_porter"

# Auth configuration
AAD_TENANT_ID=72e...45
API_CLIENT_ID=af6...dc
API_CLIENT_SECRET=abc...12
SWAGGER_UI_CLIENT_ID=d87...12
```

### Using a separate Azure Active Directory tenant

  !!! caution
      This section is only relevant it you are setting up a separate Azure Active Directory tenant for use.
      This is only recommended for development environments when you don't have the required permissions to create the necessary Azure Active Directory registrations.
      Using a separate Azure Active Directory tenant will prevent you from using certain Azure Active Directory integrated services.
      For production deployments, work with your Azure Active Directory administrator to perform the required registration

1. Create an Azure Active Directory tenant
    To create a new Azure Active Directory tenant, [follow the steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)

1. Sign in to the new tenant
    Sign in to the new tenant by running the following command (substitute the ID of the tenant you just created)

    ```bash
    az login --tenant <tenant-id-here> --allow-no-subscriptions
    ```

1. Run the `/scripts/aad-app-reg.sh` script to create API and Swagger UI app registrations and their service principals in Azure Active Directory. The details of the script are covered [app registration script](../auth.md#app-registration-script) section of the auth document. Below is a sample where `TRE_ID` has value `mytre` and the Azure location is `westeurope`:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/aad-app-reg.sh --namen TRE --swaggerui-redirecturl https://mytre.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/api/docs/oauth2-redirect --admin-consent
    ```

  With the output of the script, you can now provide the required auth related values for the following variables in the `/templates/core/.env` configuration file as described above in the "Set environment configuration variables of the Azure TRE instance" section.

1. Reset your `az` account to use the subscription you want to deploy resources into (`az list` will show the subscriptions you are signed into)

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription <name or id of subscription>
   ```

## Add admin user

Make sure the **TRE Administrators** and **TRE Users** roles, defined by the API app registration, are assigned to your user and others as required. See [Enabling users](../auth.md#enabling-users) for instructions.
